    "Now let me explain the context of this project through a scenario. Say you are a retailer and wanted to open a grocery store in the city of Toronto in Canada. As a retailer, the central location and the large crowd would provide a great distribution channel to market your products and services. Particularly, the location of the grocery store is one of the most important decisions that will determine whether the store will be a success or a failure. Wouldn’t be great if you are able to analyze the neighborhoods in Toronto which are most profitable since the success of the store depends on the population and location?"

    "To start with our analysis, firstly, we need to get the list of neighborhoods in the city of Toronto. The list is available in Wikipedia page, we will do web scraping using Python requests to extract the list of neighborhoods data. However, we need to get the geographical coordinates in the form of latitude and longitude in order to be able to use Foursquare API. In order to do so, we will fetch the coordinate data for all the neighborhoods in in the city of Toronto using the csv file. After gathering the data, we will populate the data into a pandas DataFrame. Next, we will combine both the dataframes i.e. the dataframe with the coordinate data and the dataframe with the list of neighborhoods. Then, we will visualize the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto on a map using Folium package. This will ensure that the geographical coordinate data returned by csv file are correctly plotted in the city of Toronto.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will utilize Foursquare API to explore the neighborhoods. We will set the LIMIT parameter to 100, and Radius to 500 meter. This will return the top 100 venues that are within a radius of 2000 meters. To do so, we need to register a Foursquare Developer Account. After registering, we will obtain the Foursquare ID and Foursquare secret key. Then, we will make API calls to Foursquare passing in the geographical coordinates of the neighborhoods in a Python loop. Foursquare will return the venue data in JSON format and we will extract the venue name, venue category, venue latitude and longitude. This will give us number of venues returned for each neighbourhood and then we can examine number of unique categories curated from all the returned venues. Then, we will analyze each neighbourhood by grouping the rows by neighbourhood and taking the mean of the frequency of occurrence of each venue category. \n",
